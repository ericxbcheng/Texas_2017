# Objective

  * Summarize the kernel weight data of Texas corn 2017 collected by Ruben.
  
# Method

1. Load libraries and clean up the dataset.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
weight = read.csv(file = "Corn Texas 2017 plate 2 Overall results with weight.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(weight)
```

```{r}
# After cleaning all the NAs
weight2 = weight %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(X, X.1)) %>%
  mutate(Plate = str_sub(string = .$Kernel_ID, start = 1, end = 3) %>% as.numeric(),
         Kernel = str_split(string = .$Kernel_ID, pattern = "-", simplify = TRUE)[,2] %>% as.numeric()) %>%
  na.omit()

str(weight2)
```

# Result

1. How many new weight data were collected by Ruben?

```{r}
weight2 %>%
  group_by(Plate) %>%
  summarise(nobs = n())
```
